# Q1) cp.c
### Inputs
* first enter the path of the file where to read from.
* Then enter the path of file where to write. If the file at given path does not  exist
  then a file at given path is created.

### Output
* The content of the given file is copied to a new file at the given path
* The fread and fwrite functions are used using a buffer.

# Q3) Swap.c
### Inputs
#### we assume that input elements are always integers.
* 
  * Input 'arrays' for swapping the elements of two arrays
  * Input 'elements' for swapping just two elements
* if arrays is chosen then
  * input the size of the both arrays.
  * Then enter the elements of first array in space seperated form.
  * Then enter the elements of second array in space seperated form.
*  if elements is chosen
   *  first enter the first integer
   *  then enter the second integer.

### Output
* In case of arrays first both the original arrays are printed , and then the arrays with swapped elements are printed.
* In case of the elements first both the original elements are printed , and then the swapped elements are printed.

# Q4) String_reverse.c
### Inputs
* Enter the original string to be reversed

### Output
* First the original string is printed.
* Then the reversed string is printed.

### Working
* First we calculate the size of the string using sizeStr function
* Then we take two pointers at first and last characters of the string and then we swap characters at both the pointers using a swap function.
* This process is continued untill both pointers cross each other.

# Q5) BinarySearch.c
### Inputs
* First enter the number of elements in the array
* Then enter the elements of the array in space seperated form
* Then enter the element to be searched
  
### Output
* The index of the element is returned as the output
* If the element is not present then element not present message is shown
